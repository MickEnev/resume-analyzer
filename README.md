## AI Powered Resume Analyzer

This is an app that will take in a resume and parse it for key words then use OpenAI to match those keywords to a job description and indicate whether or not you will be a good fit for the job as well as other insights. The project is in infancy as of the moment and currently can 
successfully parse a resume and organize the text by resume sections. The secitons then get parsed for popular skills and those skills as well as the job description are given to an LLM to decide if your skills fit the role and what you can do to improve.
